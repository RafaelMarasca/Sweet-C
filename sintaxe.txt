Approximate Equality Operator: This operator could be used to compare two floating-point numbers for approximate equality, taking into account rounding errors. 
For example, a ~== b could return true if the difference between a and b is less than a certain threshold. 

Approximate Inequality Operator: This operator could be used to compare two floating-point numbers for approximate inequality, taking into account rounding errors. 
For example, a ~!= b could return true if the difference between a and b is greater than a certain threshold.

Function Composition Operator: This operator could be used to compose two functions together. For example, 
f âˆ˜ g could return a new function that applies g to its input, and then applies f to the output of g.
